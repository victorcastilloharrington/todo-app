The following is a NextJS app for adding todo notes.

It is meant to showcase usage of most React Hooks, NextJS SSR, a simple NextJS REST API and it's interactions with a
postgreSQL database, as well as trying
Material UI as a UI framework.

#### Running the app locally

First, make sure to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed, and run the
following command in the root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050) with your browser to see the resulting app.

There you will find a popup with instructions as to how to add new
notes and saving the session with your added notes.
